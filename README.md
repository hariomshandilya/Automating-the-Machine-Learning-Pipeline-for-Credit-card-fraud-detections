Before going to the code it is requested to work on a Jupyter notebook or ipython notebook. If not installed on your machine you can use Google Collab.This is one of the best and my personal favorite way of working on a python script to work on a Machine Learning problem

Now, I am considering that you have read the previous article without cheating, so let’s proceed further. In this article, I will be using a library known as Pycaret that does all the heavy lifting for me and let me compare the best models side by side with just a few lines of code, which if you remember the first article took us a hell lot of code and all eternity to compare. We also able to do the most cumbersome job in this galaxy other than maintaining 75% attendance, hyperparameter tuning, that takes days and lots of code in just a couple of minutes with a couple of lines of code. It won’t be wrong if you say that this article will be a short and most effective article you will read in a while. So sit back and relax and let the fun begin.

First install the one most important thing that you will need in this article, Pycaret Library. This library is going to save you a ton of money as you know time is money, right.

To install the lib within your Ipython notebook use –
